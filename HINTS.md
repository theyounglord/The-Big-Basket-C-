### Pascal Triangle
`
Hint:-For every element you have to find its binary coefficient and then print it
`
### Binary Coefficient
`
Hint:-A binomial coefficient C(n, r) also gives the number of ways, disregarding order, that r objects can be chosen from among n objects more formally, the number of r-element subsets (or r-combinations) of a n-element set.
nCr=n!/((n-r)!*r!)
`
### Factorial of Number
`
Hint:-Factorial is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n
`
### Hollow Rectangle
`
Hint:-
You have to print some spaces between the rectangle to make it hollow rectangle.
i.e You have to print spaces instaed of "*", similar to the above question  except in 1st row, last row, 1st column and last column.
`
### Palindromic Pattern
`
Hint:-
In this Program first you have to print half pyramid after 180 degree rotaion using numbers and then you have to print half pyramid but from 2nd column.
`
### Diamond Pattern
`
Hint:- It's very similar to palindromic Pattern but with "*". In Palindromic Pattern you have to go from 1 to nth row
and in this you have to do same first but after that you have to make mirror image. So this time you need to go from nth row to 1st row.
`
### Hollow Diamond Pattern
`
Hint:-It's Very similar to Diamond Pattern.
Just check the indexing of "*" and try to figure out that at what places you have to print "*" and at what places you have to print some Some Space.
`
### Hollow Diamond inscribed in rectangle Pattern
`
Hint:-You know that you have to print some spaces from 1st row to (n-i)th row before starting to print the hollow diamond pattern.
But here instaed of spaces you have to print some "*". And after completing the upper part of hollow diamond pattern, you have to again print some "*" , exact oppossite to 
spaces you used to print in start.
`

```This hint could be confusing so if any wants to simlify this hint you can.```

### Armstrong or not
`
Hint:- A number is an Armstrong Number or narcissistic number if it is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits.
`
### Butterfly Pattern
`
Hint:- In starting you have to print from 1st row to nth row i.e. 1 to n and then for every column you have to print some star i.e. from j=1 to that particular row number i.e j=i; and then undertand that you have to print some spaces that is equal to j=1 to j=2*n-i and then again print some stars from j=1 to j=i;
