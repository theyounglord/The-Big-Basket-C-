## <img src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/xUPGcqrPHgjS1bzhWU/giphy.gif" width="70px">Why you should use this repo?
Before starting this repo i was not able to keep myself consistent and motivated towards my learning journey so i decided why not make a checklist repo which can somehow provide me a sense of achievement and also keep track of my learning the programming with c++. So thats when i decided to make this repo.

It's a long plan. It may take you months. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.

The next phase is about building logics on your own, so try as hard as possible to build or find the logics

behind the Programs on your `NoteBooks`first and then code on your systems. Also if anyone wants to edit this 

repo in his/her own way. you guys are free to do. Thank you .

In this phase we are going to solve some pattern problems which will help you to develop an idea that how should we build the logics behind the problem with our learned concepts.
This Phase require an important set of time of your's, so that when we move on to the next levels, we'll have an idea in mind that how should we'll build the logics behind the problem.

```cpp
* * * *
*     *
*     *
*     *
* * * *
```
`
Hint:-
You have to print some spaces between the rectangle to make it hollow rectangle.
i.e You have to print spaces instaed of "*", similar to the above question  except in 1st row, last row, 1st column and last column.
`
- [ ] Print the given pattern w.r.t. variable n=5 ```i.e half Pyramid using numbers```take variable n as, only input to the program / [Solution](https://github.com/theyounglord/The-Big-Basket-C-Plus-Plus/blob/main/SOLUTION.md#half-pyramid-using-numbers-pattern)
```cpp
1

Well you are doing great but one thing that's making you slow is that you don't know what is the optimization of code and how to do that?
Before moving ahead let's understand What is optimization of code and how you can implement in your code and what is the importance of that.
## Understanding the concept of Array [For Indians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyTK_g1l8V8) / [Other than Indians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOdNhPwOInc)

- [ ] Program to declare array / [Solution](https://github.com/theyounglord/The-Big-Basket-C-Plus-Plus/blob/main/SOLUTION.md#program-to-declare-array)
- [ ] Program to take take input from user for array and then print array / [Solution](https://github.com/theyounglord/The-Big-Basket-C-Plus-Plus/blob/main/SOLUTION.md#program-to-take-take-input-from-user-and-then-make-array)
- [ ] Program to take input of an array of size n and then find maximum and minimum values / [Solution](https://github.com/theyounglord/The-Big-Basket-C-Plus-Plus/blob/main/SOLUTION.md#program-to-take-input-of-an-array-of-size-n-and-then-find-maximum-and-minimum-values)
- [ ] Program to print Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies / [Solution](https://github.com/theyounglord/The-Big-Basket-C-Plus-Plus/blob/main/SOLUTION.md#program-to-print-kids-with-the-greatest-number-of-candies)
```
EXPLANATION:-
There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, 
where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has,
and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.
Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, 
after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids,
or false otherwise.
Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.
```
```cpp
Example 1:

Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.

Example 2:

Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [true,false,false,false,false] 
Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy.
Kid 1 will always have the greatest number of candies, even if a different kid is given the extra candy.

Example 3:

Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
Output: [true,false,true]

 

Constraints:

    n == candies.length
    2 <= n <= 100
    1 <= candies[i] <= 100
    1 <= extraCandies <= 50
```
- [ ] Program to print Running Sum of 1d Array / [Solution](https://github.com/theyounglord/The-Big-Basket-C-Plus-Plus/blob/main/SOLUTION.md#program-to-print-running-sum-of-1d-array)
```
Expalanation:-
Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]…nums[i]).
Return the running sum of nums.
```
```cpp
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].

Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
Output: [3,4,6,16,17]
```
